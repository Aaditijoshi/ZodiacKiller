**Contributing to ZodiacKiller**

Hello and welcome! We are so glad that you are interesting in contributing to ZodiacKiller!
We only have a couple of rules and we hope you enjoy the process :)<br />
**Contributing Rules**<br />

   1).Put all python code in zodiac.ipynb file only.<br />
   2).Don't move or delete any files. Only modify them.<br />

**Contributing Process**<br />

   1. Fork this repository to your Github account. Once it is forked, follow the steps defined under "CloningJupyterNotebook.md" in this repository (as it is a slightly different process for ipynb files). You will also need to download the dataset so you can use it while running the notebook locally on your PC.

2. Run the downloaded ipynb file on Jupyter Notebooks, and make sure the dataset is in the same directory(on your local computer) as the notebook.

3. Head to the issues tab in the Github repository and look for the one you want to work with.

4. Issues marked "hacktoberfest" and "Help Needed" are a great place to start!!

5. Comment below the issue you are working on. Closing issues will be done at the discretion of the maintainer.

6. Now you can start working on the issue in the local copy of your ipynb file (as downloaded in step 1&2). Once done working on the issue, save and upload your local copy of the ipynb to your forked repository. 

7. Now navigate to the original repo (viz "acmpesuecc/ZodiacKiller"), and create a new Pull Request. Under the Comparing Changes section, ensure you are comparing ALL FORKS of the repo. Selecting your fork as the 'head' and the original one as the 'base', create a new Pull Request with a small description explaining what you have done. Ensure that the name of the ipynb in your forked repo is the SAME as the repo you are pushing to, and all other files are unchanged.

8. Mention what Issue you have worked on. If the issue number is #3, you can mention "Closes #3" in the Pull Request description.

9. Submit your Pull Request. You PR will either i) be merged ii) be marked as Hacktober accepted, and you will gain bounty in both these cases, 
OR iii)changes will be requested iv)if outside the submission window/ after issue has been closed/does not solve the issue, then PR will be ignored/marked as invalid in which case no bounty will be awarded.

Note: Please create separate Pull Requests for each issue. One PR closing multiple issues will NOT be encouraged.


It's that easy! We hope you enjoy contributing to our repository. **Don't hesitate to contact any of the maintainers or ACM team about any problems!**
